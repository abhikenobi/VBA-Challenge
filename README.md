### Part 1:

Part 1 of the Homework required you to create a run a VBA script using the alphabetical_testing.xlsm as a test-subject file, as it contains the same type of numerical stockmarket data as the actual file, but the quantity was reduced significantly in order to quickly run the script and find/troubleshoot bugs.

#### Requirements for the VBA script:
___
    *Be able to run through all Worksheets in the file automatically rather than
    manually running the script for each separate Worksheet
    *After testing on the test-subject file, have the code be able to run in the
    actual file within 3-5 min
    *Have the script be able to loop through all the data, compile, and then output:
        1. The ticker symbol of each stock
        2. Yearly change in stock price for that stock by calculating the difference
        between the opening price at the beginning of a given year and the closing price at the end of that year
        3. The percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a year to
        the closing price at the end of that year.
        4. The total stock volume of that stock for each year.
    *Conditional formatting within the script to recolor cells containing the Yearly Change
    data dependent on if the stock price rose or fell at the end of the year vs. the beginning
    
### Part 2: Bonus

The bonus part of the Homework required extra additions to your Script in order to loop through all the data that was outputted in Part 1 and find for each year:
    - Greatest % Increase
    - Greatest % Decrease
    - Greatest Total Stock Volume
The script should then be able to output the stock ticker and value for all 3 of the categories into a separate table.
